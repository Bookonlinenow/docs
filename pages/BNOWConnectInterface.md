# Introduction

This document provides information on integrating _Central_ _Reservation
System_ (CRS) or a _Property Management System_ (PMS) with
BookOnlineNow. BookOnlineNow is the leading Booking Engine solution.

_BNOWConnect_ is a set of services for _Property Management System_
(PMS) systems to connect with BookOnlineNow. As availability and rates
change, the PMS would send updates using _BNOWConnect_ to the booking
engine. As bookings/reservations are made by consumers, _BNOWConnect_
would make available the reservations to the PMS using a reservation
pull mechanism.

Section 2 of this document specifies the interface that PMS needs
implement to push update messages to the booking engine.

Section 3 of this document specifies the interface that _BnÎ¿wConnect_
makes available to PMS to pull reservations.
